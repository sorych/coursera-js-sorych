  <h1>Traffic light</h1>

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
			<div class="section-title" id="red">Red</div>
		<p>The red signal prohibits any traffic from proceeding.</p>
</div>
	<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
	
		<div class="section-title" id="yellow">Yellow</div>
		<p>The amber (yellow) light warns that the signal is about to change to red. 
		In a number of countries – among them the United Kingdom – a phase during which red and yellow 
		are displayed together indicates that the signal is about to change to green. 
		Actions required by drivers on a yellow light vary, with some jurisdictions requiring 
		drivers to stop if it is safe to do so, and others allowing drivers to go through the intersection 
		if safe to do so.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
		<div class="section-title" id="green">Green</div>
		<p>The green light allows traffic to proceed in the direction denoted, if it is safe to do so and 
		there is room on the other side of the intersection.
